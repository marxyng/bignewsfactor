            <h1>Can Universal Basic Income be brought to fruition?</h1>
            <br>

            I first heard about it talking to friends in academia.  The next place I heard about it is from Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook.  After actually 
            <br>
            paying attention to what Mark had to say, I actually like the idea.   The concept of being able to live with a standard basic income that pays all 
            <br>
            the essentials for living. There definitely would be a problem coming from the Republicans.  They would say how would you pay for it.  That is a good 
            <br>
            question.  The only way I can think of is to raise taxes.   
        </p>
        
         
         <p>
         To raise taxes would cause some people to be livid, but maybe if the taxes were raise correctly.  When I say correctly, I'm pertaining to raising <br>
         
         taxes on people that can afford it.  The people that could afford something like this would, well I'm certain they would fight back in some way.  
         <br/>
         I know we would probably see a lot of money being given to the Republican party.  With that terrible decision by the court on Citizens United, the 
         <br/>
         amount we are talking is simply tons of cash.  Since it's such a big change, the backlash would probably be close to the Obamacare level or bigger.  
         </p>
         
         <p>
         The advantages of this law I think far outweigh the disadvantages.  I think this bill would be very helpful to a lot of people who would like to try 
         <br/>
         new things.  One of the main things I can think of is not liking your job and being able to become an entrepreneur.  Since this bill would pay the 
         <br/>
         essentials, a person would be able to learn something new without the fear of losing everything.  Say for instance, if someone wanted to code, they
         <br/>
         could take out the time from their schedule necessary and learn.  People who wanted to work on new inventions would be able to. The disadvantages I can 
         <br/>
         see is some individuals not wanting to do anything and just playing the role of a bum.  Another disadvantage I can see from this bill is the higher 
         <br/>
         taxes.  Like I said before the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. It would be a period of excitement.  If this bill were to pass it would create 
         <br/>
         a period that could be labeled the New Renaissance.  This bill basically would give the individual the ability to create.
